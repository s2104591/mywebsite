            St Peter. "The history of the site is based around a great deal of Christian mythology. It is said that following 	<br>
            Jesus’ crucifixion, one of his twelve disciples, Peter from Galilee, underwent a long journey to Rome, 	<br>
            and upon arriving was martyred by the Emperor Nero. Peter allegedly died close to an Egyptian obelisk  	<br> 
            in the Circus; a site which still stands today. The spot was initially marked by a red rock, then a shrine, <br>
            before the first St Peter’s Basilica was built in the fourth century. Eventually, this wooden structure 	<br>	
            fell into disrepair, and a huge construction project was commissioned to replace it, which was to last		<br> 
            over a century! The project was commissioned by Pope Julius II and the new Basilica was finally officially 	<br>
            opened on 18th November, 1626."
